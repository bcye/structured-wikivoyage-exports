    "'''Enschede''' is a city in the [[Netherlands]]. It is the largest city of the Twente region (a former center of textile industry), and also of the [[Overijssel]] province. Enschede was designated the greenest town in the Netherlands in 2003.\n",

    "On May 13, 2000, a fireworks storage in Enschede exploded, destroying an entire neighborhood and killing 23 people, including 4 firemen. This catastrophe is known in the Netherlands as the Vuurwerkramp, Dutch for ''fireworks disaster''. Since this event, the city has undergone a major reconstruction process. After the fall of the textile industry, Enschede strives to become a center of business, innovation and technology through the Business and Science park next to the University of Twente.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a city famous for being \"destroyed and reconstructed\" many times, Enschede does not offer much in terms of historical attractions. However, the city has nice displays of contemporary Dutch architecture, particularly in the Roombeek neighborhood and at University of Twente, and its nightlife, cultural vibrancy and shopping options are quite developed for a city of its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "==Talk==\n",
    "Official language is Dutch. Almost all understand English. Since Enschede is close to Germany, there are more tourist information brochures in German than English.\n",

    "From elsewhere in the Netherlands, Enschede is easily accessible by train from all major Dutch cities, and can be reached from smaller cities with at most one or two transfers. The journey time from Amsterdam is approximately two hours. An excellent (train only) travel planner is available at [http://ns.nl/ Nationale Spoorwegen]. Hourly intercity trains from [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]], [[The Hague]] and [[Zwolle]] terminate at {{marker|type=go|name=Enschede railway station|lat=52.222372|long=6.890495}}. If you need to use a connecting bus or ferry from within the Netherlands, use [http://9292.nl 9292].\n",
    "\n",
    "From Germany, direct trains (ending in Enschede railway station) are available from Gronau, Dortmund, and MÃ¼nster. From MÃ¼nster, it takes 1 hr 20 min by hourly regional train to Enschede. To reach Enschede from Berlin, a stopover is available in Hengelo (a small city about 10 minutes by train from Enschede). Further guidance is available at [http://www.db.de Die Bahn].\n",

    "There is a large parking lot underneath the market square in the centre of the city, the H.J. van Heekplein, which provides approximately 2000 parking spaces for visitors arriving by car.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a cheaper park-and-ride solution available at the expanded P+R Zuiderval. Frequent buses travel from here directly to the city center (approximately 5 minutes by bus). This is especially useful if you are arriving in Enschede via the highway, as the lot is just off the highway exit.\n",

    "==Get around==\n",
